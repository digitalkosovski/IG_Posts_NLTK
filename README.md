# IG_Posts_NLTK
This is a basic excercise of text manipulation of scraped IG posts with Pandas and NLTK, without lemmatization and with visualizations made on Voyant.

The repository contains:
* A Json file with data scraped from the IG accounts of the 5 most populars influencers of the UFC.
* A Python script with a workflow to extract the textual data from the Json file, manipulate it with Pandas and export it as txt.
* Exemple of a wordcloud made in Voyant.
