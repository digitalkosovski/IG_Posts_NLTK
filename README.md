# IG_Posts_NLTK
An excercise with scraped IG posts with NLTK

The repository contains:
* A Json file with data scraped from the IG accounts of the 5 most populars influencers of the UFC.
* A Python script suggesting a workflow to extract the textual data from the Json file, manipulate it with Pandas and export it as txt.
* Exemples of Wordclouds made in Voyant on the basis of the text files.
